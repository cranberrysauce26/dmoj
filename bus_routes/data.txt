N stations.

N = 5, K = 2, P = 3.

1 2 3 4 5

a b a a b

a b a b a

a b b a b

cnt = 3

1 2 ... K are taken 

1. Every window of size P must have at least one of each i, 1 <= i <= K.

First person choose his path. 

a1 = 1, a2, ..., ak

Then second person

b1 = 2, b2, ..., b[m]

1...K who does K+1?
