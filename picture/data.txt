What's the algorithm?

First compress everything.

Deal with indices instead of values

So have a compressY[i] is the i'th y value

and ymap[y] maps y to i.

ok...

Now as you drag from left to right, 
keep track of the yvalues that are filled

That is, slide[i] == # of rectangles that contain the interval [i, i+1]

Then sort the points by x value, breaking ties by first the type add before end


Do a difference array!!! Then update.

Walk along each element! Then if it transitions to zero, increment perimeter!s

Specifically, a[i][j] is the number of rectangles that cover (i, j) by indices

Then do a line sweep. 

i.e., for each x value, go up. if current is zero
