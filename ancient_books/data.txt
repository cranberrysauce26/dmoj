Call a move essential if it takes p[i] closer to i.
Or it is a bridge

Claim:

If s = 0, then there exists a way to sort using only essential or bridge moves.

This is true if there is exactly 1 cycle.

If there are 2 cycles, it is true as well.

Case 1:

The cycles [l1, r1] and [l2, r2] do not overlap.

Case 2: [l1, r1] contains [l2, r2].

This is true as well.

Case 3: l1 < l2 < r1 < r2
