Observation 1: dp[i][i] = Repitivity of s[1...i]

Observation 2: dp[i][j] = dp[j][i]

Observation 3: dp[i-1][i] = 1/2 dp[i][i]

Observation 4: dp[0][i] = 1

Observation 5: dp[i][j] depends on whether s[i]==s[j]
	If they're the same, add dp[i-1][j]+dp[i][j-1]
	If they're different, do above then subtract dp[i-1][j-1]
